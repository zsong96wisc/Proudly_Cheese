Description:

Wisconsin is well-known for its dairy industry, and using information technology could be helpful and efficient for local farmers 
to track their business. In this project, an interactive data visualizer with a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) will be 
designed and implemented to help local farms to analyze and report on the milk that has been sold by their farmers. 
     
The application will be able to load files containing data of a calendar month, and generate relative farm, annual, 
and monthly reports of the farm.
